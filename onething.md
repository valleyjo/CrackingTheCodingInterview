# Chapter 4
1) BFS refresher
2) Objects can be built recursivly rather than constructing the reference first and passing that through the recursive method
3) Iterative is not always faster. Wait to create the object until it's needed/
4) Do work on the way "up" the recursive call stack, after the recursive method completes
5) Changing param values as a "window" down a recursive call stack
6) Just keep doing examples. Nail each sub-part of the problem.
7)
    1) When dealing with directed graphs, use two for O(1) lookup in both directions
    2) Change the words to change the arrow direction if it's not making sense ("depends on" or "built before")
    3) Topological sort
